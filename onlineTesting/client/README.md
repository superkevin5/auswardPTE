The inevitable consequences  #404 
rampant corruption, an absence of globally 
competitive Chinese companies,  #404 
waste of resources, rampant environmental  #404 
and soaring inequality. Above all, the monopoly 
over power of an ideologically bankrupt communist 
party is  #404 with the pluralism of opinion, security of 
property and vibrant competition on which a dynamic economy 
depends. As a result, Chinese development remains parasitic on 
know-how and institutions developed elsewhere.
